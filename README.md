# TEMEPRATURE CONTROLER FOR PLASTIC EXTRUDER

This is the code to control the heating elements of a plastic extruder
using Arduino Mega 2520. 

The hardware is composed by:
- LCD 16x2 display
- 2 thermocuple type K
- 2 cylindrical heating element

- Encoder to set the temeprature via display. 

# Set mode

After the starting messege you will the temperatrue of both termocuple in celcius degress. The display is updated every 2000ms.
